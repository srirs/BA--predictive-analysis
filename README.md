# BA--predictive-analysis
Objective:
The primary goal of the project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a flight booking will be completed or not. This prediction is based on a variety of input features related to the booking process, such as flight details, origin, destination, purchase lead time, and others.
Key Steps and Components:
Data Collection: The project begins with the collection of data related to flight bookings. This data likely includes various attributes or features associated with each booking, such as flight information, customer details, and purchase lead time.
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and preprocessed before building the predictive model. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This step often includes data visualization techniques to understand the relationships between different variables and identify patterns in the data.
Model Building: Machine learning models, such as Random Forest Classifier, are trained using the preprocessed data. These models learn from historical data to predict whether a flight booking will be completed.
Model Evaluation: The predictive model's performance is assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and K-fold cross-validation depending on the nature of the problem (binary classification in this case).
Visualization: Various visualizations, including histograms, heatmaps, and box plots, may be created to present and interpret the data and model results effectively.
Data Mapping: Categorical data, such as flight origins and destinations, may be mapped to numerical values to facilitate data manipulation and modelling.
Summary and Insights: The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing flight booking completion, as well as a predictive model that can be used to make future predictions.
